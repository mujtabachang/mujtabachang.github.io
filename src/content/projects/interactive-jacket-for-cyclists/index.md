Interactive Jacket for Cyclists is a fun project where we (me and Muhammad Habib) turn an ordinary jacket into a wonderful interactive jacket which can display turn signals on the back. These turn signals (LEDs) can be activated by using hand gestures (waving your hand). Also it features front and back LEDs for increased visibility for the cyclist.
